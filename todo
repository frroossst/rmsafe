- Add checks for vital fileglobs (~, /)
- Also check for:
    mv /path/to/important/files/* /tmp/ 
        this command would move all files in the directory /path/to/important/files/ to the /tmp/ directory, 
        which is typically intended for temporary files and may be periodically cleared by the system. 
        This could result in the permanent loss of important files.

    mv /path/to/system/files/* /path/to/other/system/files/ 
        This command would move all files in the directory /path/to/system/files/ to the 
        /path/to/other/system/files/ directory. This could cause damage to the system or make it unstable or 
        unbootable if it moves critical files.

    mv /path/to/files /path/to/files/ 
        This command would move the directory /path/to/files/ to itself, effectively replacing the directory
        with an empty one.

- Test if these checks work
