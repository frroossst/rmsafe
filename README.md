# rmsafe (remove_safely)

## Introduction

After (almost) accidentally removing a file with about week's worth of changes for my C lang assignment, I took it as an excuse to lear a bit

## Basics

Instead of just rm(ing) files and folders, they instead are moved to the local trash or custom path location.

## Usage
